# Type of Tests
![[Notched and Unnotched Izod Test.png]]
## Method A
![[Method A and C for Izod Test.png]]
- Produces stress concentration $\rightarrow$ scatter in energy-to-break is reduced $\rightarrow$ increaases the probability of brittle
- Material is held as a vertical cantilever beam. The line of initial contact is a t a fixed distance from the specimen clamp and from the centerline of the notch and on the same face as the notch.
## Method C
- Produces stress concentration $\rightarrow$ scatter in energy-to-break is reduced $\rightarrow$ increaases the probability of brittle
- Similar to Method A, but there is a procedure addition for determining the energy expended in tossing a portion of the specimen (Estimated Net Izod Impact Test).
- Preferred over Method A for materials that have an izon impact resistance less that 27 J/m.
## Method D
- Produces stress concentration $\rightarrow$ scatter in energy-to-break is reduced $\rightarrow$ increaases the probability of brittle
- Measure plastic's notch sensitivity by comparing the energies to break speciments having different radii at the base of the notch. 
	- Stress concentration $\uparrow$ when notch radius $\downarrow$
	- When stress concentration $\uparrow$ then localized rates-of-strain $\uparrow$
- Slope of line connecting the values of impact resistance, see [[#Slope of Impact Resistance]]
## Method E
![[Method E Izod Test.png]]
- Similar with Method A, except the specimen is reversed in the vise of the machine $180\degree$ to the usual striking position, such that the striker of the apparatus impacts the specimen on the face opposite of the notch.
- Estimates the impact strength on unnotched specimens
# Significance and Use
## Energy Lost
**Energy lost** by the pendulum during the breakage of the specimen is the sum of the following:
- Energy to initiate fracture of the specimen
- Energy to propagate fracture across the specimen
- Energy to throw the free end of the broken specimen
- Energy to bend the specimen
- Energy to produce vibration in the pendulum arm
- Energy to produce vibration or horizontal movement of the machine frame or base
- Energy to overcome friction in the pendulum bearing and pendulum air drag
- Energy to indent or deform plastically the specimen at the line of impact
- Energy to overcome the friction caused by the rubbing of striker over the face of the bent specimen

**TL;DR**
1. Specimen $\rightarrow$ fracture, bend, indent, and throw
2. Pendulum $\rightarrow$ air drag, vibration, friction
## Energy by Type of Material
Energy used on brittle and ductile materials:
- Brittle $\rightarrow$ energy to initiate fracture and throw specimen
- Ductile $\rightarrow$ fracture propagation energy $\textgreater$ fracture initiation energy
	- Significant Factors
		- Energy to propagate the fracture
		- Energy to prodcue vibration on pendulum arm
		- Energy to overcome friction on the pendulum over the specimen
- Soft materials $\rightarrow$ energy to bend and indentation losses
- Tough materials $\rightarrow$ pendulum may not have enough energy to break the extreme fibers
## Type of Failures
1. C (Complete Break)
A break where the specimen seperates into two or more pieces
2. H (Hinge Break)
An incomplete break, such that one part of the specimen cannot support itself above the horizontal when the other part is held vertically
3. P (Partial Break)
An incomplete break that does not meet the definition for a hinge break but has fractured at least 90% of the distance between the vertex of the notch and the opposite side
4. NB (Non-Break)
An incomplete break where the fracture extends less than 90% of the distance between the vertex of the notch and the opposite side
# Cantilever Beam Test (Method A)
- Striker of pendulum $\rightarrow$ hardened cylindrical steel $\rightarrow$ radius $0.80 \pm 0.20mm$ 
- Line of contact $\rightarrow$ located at the center of percussion of pendulum $\rightarrow$ $\pm2.54mm$
- Vertical height of fall of striker $\rightarrow$ $610\pm2mm$ $\rightarrow$ produce velocity of $3.5m/s$ (see [[#Velocity of Striker]])
- Effective length of pendulum $\rightarrow$ between 0.33 to 0.40m $\rightarrow$ $30\degree-60\degree$
- 
# Study Case
- Same groups of specimen $\rightarrow$ different energy absoption, type of breaks, critical widths, etc $\rightarrow$ different processing and conditioning environments
- 
# Calculation
## Slope of Impact Resistance
Materials with low values of $b$ are insensitive to differences in notch radius; while the energy-to-break materials with high values of $b$ is highly dependent on notch radius.

$$b=(E_{2}-E_{1})/(R_{2}-R_{1})$$
$\begin{aligned}&E_2&&:\text{average impact resistance for the larger notch, J/m of notch}\\&E_1&&:\text{average impact resistance for the smaller notch, J/m of notch}\\&R_2&&:\text{radius of the larger notch}\\&R_1&&:\text{radius of the smaller notch}\end{aligned}$
## Distance from Axis (Method A)
$$L=(g/4\pi^2)p^2$$
$\begin{aligned}&L&&:\text{distance from axis of support to the center of percussion}\\&g&&:\text{gravitational acceleration}\\&\pi&&:\text{3.1416}\\&p&&:\text{period of a single complete swing}\end{aligned}$
## Velocity of Striker
$$V=(2gh)^{0.5}$$
$\begin{aligned}&V&&:\text{velocity of the striker at the moment of impact, m/s}\\&g&&:\text{local gravitational acceleration, m/s2}\\&h&&:\text{vertical height of fall of the striker, m}\end{aligned}$
