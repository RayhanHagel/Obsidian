For citation, using Zotero and Obsidian is way more preferable since we can show the summary of annotated notes without having to open each pdf and searching for the annotation one by one. TO do so, follow this video below:

Another alternative is to use Mendeley, but I dont think there is an easy way to connect Mendeley with Obsidian. So I recommend to use Zotero for this.
