## Notes


> <mark class="hltr-green">The uptrend of human population results in higher needs of energy. Nowadays, most of the energy demand is fulfilled by the burning of fossil fuel, which emits massive amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) [2]. Greenhouse gases are mainly made up of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=&annotation=7GZ2W6GV)
**🏷️** | CO2 generation | | greenhouse gas | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">GHG trap heat in the atmosphere and contributing significantly to the rise in temperature and global warming [3–5]. The fast growing of the CO2 concentration globally also leads to the potential of irregular climate and rise of sea-level that can threat sea life and most importantly the activity and survival of human beings [</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=&annotation=SZZB8SPA)
**🏷️** | climate change | | greenhouse gas | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">In order to solve this problem, The Paris Agreement was introduced at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) during the annual 21st Conference of Parties (COP21), since 1995 that was agreed upon 12th December 2020, represented by 197 nations leader that agreed to act upon battling with the danger of climate change together with adapting the huge impacts on the humans existence, The Paris Agreement targets to control the global temperature rise below 275.15 K as further precautions will be taken to restrict the temperature rise to 247.65 K</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=&annotation=BFMJHTH3)

> <mark class="hltr-green">To tackle climate change and to meet the renewable energy production target set by the Malaysia’s government, CO2 utilization plays an important role. It offers benefits to not only reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, but also to produce valuable products, such as formic acid and synthetic gas.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=2&annotation=CWQK22RW)
**🏷️** | carbon capture | | CCUS | | syngas | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">strategies to minimize the CO2 concentration level in the atmosphere, which are (i) by avoiding the CO2 production, (ii) through the conversion and utilization of CO2, and (iii) by extracting and storing the produced CO2 from climate balance</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=2&annotation=8ZKQBJF9)
**🏷️** | carbon capture | | CCUS | | greenhouse gas | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Besides, it is more economically preferable because the product obtained through the CO2 conversion process can be sold to counter the production cost. Conversion of CO2 into biogas, bioelectricity, heat, and valuable chemicals are some of the examples of CO2 utilization [19]. Among these, CO2 conversion with methane (CH4) is the most attractive as it allows the conversion of two greenhouse gases, CO2 and CH4, simultaneously into valuable synthetic gas, such as hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO)</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=2&annotation=Z6UH4WED)
**🏷️** | carbon capture | | carbon dioxide reforming of methane | | CCUS | | greenhouse gas | | syngas | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">However, the molecular structure of both CH4 and CO2 are stable and hence, significant amount of energy, in other words, high production cost, is needed to convert it into valuable syngas</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=2&annotation=JMX8MH6K)
**🏷️** | CCUS | | syngas | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">In order to solve and overcome the dramatically increment of GHG emission, many approaches have been proposed, including the carbon capture and storage (CCS), carbon capture and utilization (CCU), lowering the usage of fossil fuel, and pushing the needs of clean and renewable energy usage</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=2&annotation=UHGY6APH)
**🏷️** | carbon capture and storage | | CCUS | | greenhouse gas | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technique which can capture up to 90% of the CO2 emitted. Generally, CCS consists of 4 main processes, which are (i) capture of CO2, (ii) separate the CO2, (iii) send the CO2 to desired storage location, and (iv) store the CO2</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=2&annotation=U9PB4ATQ)
**🏷️** | carbon capture and storage |

> <mark class="hltr-red">Moreover, CCS treats CO2 as waste and hence, this method does not meet the aim of sustainability</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=3&annotation=GXFL6358)
**🏷️** | carbon capture and storage | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Hence, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has been introduced as it handles CO2 as renewable carbon source, instead of waste. The goal of this technology is to recycle the unwanted CO2 into valuable products. For example, formic acid (FA) is one of the valuable products that can be produced through CO2 utilization</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=3&annotation=BIKGISIL)
**💬** formic acid is for processing textiles and leather, preservative, and antibacterial agent (in livestock feed).

> <mark class="hltr-green">The working principle of photocatalytic CO2 reduction with water (H2O) is similar with the natural photosynthesis process, in which the CO2 and H2O can be converted into oxygen (O2) and carbohydrate in the presence of sunlight. Process of converting sunlight (solar energy) into carbohydrate (chemical energy stored in the bond) involves 2 main reactions, the water oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction [56]. The process can utilize CO2 into valuable product such as methanol</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=6&annotation=C7IW5BJX)
**🏷️** | CCUS | | photocatalytic reduction | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">There are few products that can be obtained through the photocatalytic CO2 reduction, including formic acid (HCOOH), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (HCHO), methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (C2H5OH) and methane (CH4) [83]. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction is nonspontaneous (external energy is needed) to initiate the reaction, with the least for the formation of formic acid and maximum for the formation of CH4. Among the abovementioned products, CO and CH4 are the main products during the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 in the gas phase system, but the production of CO can also be manipulated by altering the electron density</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=6&annotation=H4DZFNRE)

**🏷️** | CCUS | | plasma technology | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">In thermal plasma, the temperature equilibrium between the plasma particles is achieved and hence, most of the plasma particles consist of similar temperature. Therefore, thermal plasma can be expressed with a single temperature value</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=7&annotation=GLI3L2BD)
**🏷️** | CCUS | | plasma technology | | thermal plasma | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">On the other hand, in nonthermal plasma, the temperatures between the particles are not balanced, which might be due to the insufficient of time or energy to achieve equilibrium state or certain cooling mechanism is implemented to avoid the heating of entire gas. Hence, non-thermal plasma can also be referred as low-temperature plasma or non-equilibrium plasma</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZVKRXJP5?page=7&annotation=K752X98M)
