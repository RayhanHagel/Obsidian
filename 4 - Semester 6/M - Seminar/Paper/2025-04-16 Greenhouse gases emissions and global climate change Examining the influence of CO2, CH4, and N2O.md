## Notes


> <mark class="hltr-green">Key GHG components such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are considered, along with data on emissions across various economic sectors.</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=&annotation=GZS5YIA4)

> <mark class="hltr-green">The essence of the mechanism is as follows: solar radiation, mainly in the form of visible light, passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth&#39;s surface. There, the energy from the sun is absorbed by land, water, and vegetation, and re-emitted as heat in the form of longer-wave infrared radiation (Kaltenegger, 2017). Normally, this radiation would escape into space. GHGs, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and others, are capable of absorbing a portion of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth (Ledley et al., 1999).</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=2&annotation=3HIDMTRU)
**üè∑Ô∏è** | greenhouse gas | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">The interaction of infrared radiation with GHG molecules, primarily CO2, CH4, and N2O, induces vibrational or rotational motions in these molecules. This internal motion imparts energy to the molecules that is radiated back into the atmosphere (Mitchell, 1989). This process generates additional thermal radiation, increasing the temperature of the surrounding air and the Earth&#39;s surface (Ming et al., 2014).</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=2&annotation=9DBJ2RFX)
**üè∑Ô∏è** | greenhouse gas | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">The increase in GHG concentrations as a result of human activity enhances the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming. This process influences the climate, causing changes in weather patterns, sea levels, and other aspects of the environment. Combating climate change involves reducing GHG emissions and exploring sustainable solutions for the future.</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=2&annotation=SRULT3TB)
**üè∑Ô∏è** | climate change | | greenhouse gas | 

> <mark class="hltr-purple">Data on emission levels, climate trends, and other relevant information were gathered from reliable sources such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=2&annotation=93DQWXD2)

> <mark class="hltr-green">International efforts to reduce GHG emissions have involved several significant initiatives and agreements. The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, imposed commitments on developed countries to reduce GHG emissions.</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=3&annotation=WSCXS7IE)
**üè∑Ô∏è** | climate change agreement | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">In response to these limitations, the Paris Agreement was reached in 2015, providing a comprehensive framework for participating countries to set national GHG reduction targets. It acknowledged the special responsibility of developed countries and provided financial support for developing nations.</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=3&annotation=3IHU4QKV)
**üè∑Ô∏è** | climate change agreement | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">These agreements, therefore, serve as important instruments in the global effort to mitigate the impact of GHG and ensure a sustainable future for the planet</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=3&annotation=XBPALSYK)
**üè∑Ô∏è** | climate change agreement | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">GHG, such as CO2, CH4, and N2O, are capable of capturing and retaining thermal radiation in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. They play a primary role in the greenhouse effect. CO2, CH4, and N2O retain heat due to their ability to absorb and emit thermal infrared radiation. This process is associated with the specific molecular structure of these gases.</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=3&annotation=8K797UCP)
**üè∑Ô∏è** | greenhouse gas | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Taking into account the heat-trapping characteristics measured in terms of global warming potential, CH4 is 23 times more effective, and N2O is 296 times more effective than CO2 (IPCC, 2001; Liu and Greaver, 2009). However, the amount of CO2 in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere significantly exceeds the amounts of CH4 or N2O making it of much greater concern. The continued accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere makes it the most troubling of the three major GHGs.</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=3&annotation=UHNYQ67R)

> <mark class="hltr-green">The primary gas responsible for climate change, constituting 73.5 % of the total emissions is CO2, with emissions rising with a pronounced increase after 2000. Accounting for 21.5 % and 4.9 %, respectively, CH4 and N2O emissions are also on the rise but at a lower rate</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=5&annotation=633XU4L2)

> <mark class="hltr-green">The increase in GHG emissions after 2000 can be explained by rapid economic growth and industrialization in developing countries, leading to increased industrial production and energy consumption</mark> [üîó](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WRTF9L6G?page=5&annotation=H24YZ6I2)
