**🏷️** | climate change | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">CO2, primarily released through the combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes, acts as a potent greenhouse gas by trapping heat and intensifying the natural greenhouse effect.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=&annotation=2G89UKN6)
**🏷️** | climate change | 


### 📍 Page 2

> <mark class="hltr-green">As a result, countries have pledged the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 ◦C above pre-industrial levels [8]. Therefore to mitigate the impact of CO2 emissions on our climate, efficient CO2 capture technologies need to be developed with an ambitious goal of net zero emissions by 2050 [9], so as to limit the impact of global warming [10].</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=2&annotation=W8QZP6YZ)
**🏷️** | climate change agreement | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">CO2 from the respective flue gas streams can then be remove via different techniques, including absorption and adsorption techniques, membrane technology, yogens, microalgae and chemical looping</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=2&annotation=K23VBZ46)
**🏷️** | flue gas | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Absorption involves CO2 dissolving into a solvent, which may react chemically with the solvent (chemical solvents) or bound by weak van der Waals forces (physical solvents)</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=2&annotation=9H3IHQ45)
**🏷️** | absorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">However, energy consumption for solvent regeneration was at a high, accounting for 65% of the total power plant energy consumption [22], which is about 3.7 GJ/ton CO2</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=2&annotation=MWHN8V9M)

> <mark class="hltr-green">Coal was found to be the greatest contributor to the emissions, followed by oil and natural gas</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=3&annotation=TWXQAKV3)
**🏷️** | climate change | | emission | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">arbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) scheme is widely encouraged for power plants and industries to adopt</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=3&annotation=8UDHCKWA)
**🏷️** | carbon capture | | CCUS | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">It can cost less at about USD  15–25 ton 1 CO2 when sequestering from highly concentrated CO2 streams (eg. ethanol production), or at a higher range of USD 40–120  ton 1 CO2 when sequestering from lower CO2 concentration streams (eg. power plants, cement plants)</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=3&annotation=KULNFB3B)
**🏷️** | carbon capture | | high cost | 


### 📍 Page 4

> <mark class="hltr-green">CO2 emissions from industrial processes, particularly power plants and various industrial facilities, are major contributors to the ongoing global environmental and climate isis. To combat this issue, significant efforts have been made to develop and implement technologies aimed at capturing CO2 before its release into the atmosphere.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=4&annotation=XBJ9MYG8)
**🏷️** | carbon capture | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Absorption captures CO2 via two mechanisms, physisorption and chemisorption. It involves the dissolution or chemical reaction of CO2 molecules within a solvent. CO2 is captured from the waste gas and is diffused into the solvent.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=4&annotation=V37SPDLL)
**💬** explains about absorption
**🏷️** | absorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Physical solvents interact with CO2 via week van der Waals, and therefore dissolve CO2 into its liquid media. The process follows Henry’s law, where CO2 solubility in the solvent and thus absorption rate, is directly proportional to the CO2 partial pressure in the gas phase, where an equilibrium is established between the gas and liquid phases. On the other hand, these two factors are inversely proportionate to temperature.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=4&annotation=XPSHGEA6)
**💬** explains about physical solvents (physisorption)
**🏷️** | absorption | | physical solvents | | physisorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">This may be seen as a drawback, as solvent systems would require high pressures and extremely low temperatures of below subzero degree Celsius for effective CO2 capture, which leads to high operating cost</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=4&annotation=HBMEAFJD)
**💬** why absorption mechanism is not used
**🏷️** | absorption | | physical solvents | | physisorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">While chemical solvents react with CO2 to form carbamates or bicarbonates, making them more selective towards capturing CO2 and ineasing the capture capacity and rate. Chemical solvents are often unaffected by acid gas partial pressure, and is able to capture CO2 at ppm concentrations [48]. However, compared to physical solvents, chemical solvents’ selectivity between acid gases are lower, and they require adequate heat for CO2 capture with the possibility of side reaction occurring, and higher energy for solvent regeneration</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=4&annotation=BXR236F3)
**🏷️** | chemisorption | | adsorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">Common classes of chemical solvents include amines [24], ILs [25], nanofluids [26] etc., where systems involving water, though effective, are often frowned upon as they would need an even greater amount of energy for solvent regeneration. This is due to water’s high heat capacity and enthalpy of vaporization, where temperatures would need to be heated above it for CO2 desorption</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=4&annotation=79PJ57FN)
**💬** why chemisorption is not used
**🏷️** | absorption | | chemisorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Adsorption, in contrast, involves the adherence of gas molecules such as CO2, onto the surface of a solid substrate, known as an adsorbent. These solid adsorbent materials are seen to be advantageous over liquid based absorbents, where they are less toxic, yield less waste, and is able to withstand higher operating temperatures</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=4&annotation=68IJGD96)

**🏷️** | surface area | 

> <mark class="hltr-blue">In addition, pore size and degree and type of functionalization of the pores and surface can also influence the CO2 capture capacity and rate</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=4&annotation=MIZVVDDV)
**🏷️** | pore size | | type of functionalization | 

> <mark class="hltr-blue">Most materials such as MOFs, activated carbon, zeolites or silicate materials involve physisorption, and therefore CO2 capture capacity ineases at higher pressure</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=4&annotation=FP2JTJY4)
**🏷️** | MOF | | pressure | | physisorption |

**💬** mechanism of physical adsorption
**🏷️** | adsorption | | physisorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Consequently, desorption of CO2 also requires lower energy compared to conventional materials [52], making adsorption techniques a desirable alternative for CO2 sequestration.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MK8P75JQ?page=4&annotation=JTD5ZRZK)
