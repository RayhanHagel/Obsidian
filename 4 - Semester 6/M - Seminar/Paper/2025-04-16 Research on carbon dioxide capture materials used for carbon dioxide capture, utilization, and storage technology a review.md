> <mark class="hltr-green">The growth of global population and the resulting energy demand will lead to continued increase of CO2 emissions and make global warming more serious</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=2&annotation=5Z7JQYEI)
**🏷️** | CO2 generation | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Global warming will not only pose a direct threat to the survival of the present generation, but will also adversely affect future generations through the destruction of ecosystems, droughts and floods, and other extreme climate phenomena</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=2&annotation=VFW7KSIV)
**🏷️** | climate change | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">CCUS technology mainly involves five parts, namely CO2 emission, capture, transport, utilization,  and storage</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=2&annotation=AYEYIQRD)
**🏷️** | CCUS | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">At present, industrial sectors such as petrochemicals, steel, and coal-fired power generation account for the  majority of carbon dioxide emissions. Since fossil energy releases a lot of CO2 in the process of use and combustion, it  must be captured and reduced to achieve the goal of “double carbon.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=2&annotation=7KVCSQYG)
**🏷️** | CO2 generation | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">The concentrated CO2 is transferred after being captured until it  can be utilized again or permanently stored. The CO2 that is  captured can be raw materials for chemical production, or to improve the concentration of CO2 in the greenhouse to  achieve the purpose of improving photosynthesis. Additionally, carbon dioxide can be permanently stored in exhausted oil and gas fields to prevent it from contributing to the greenhouse effect. It can also be injected into oil wells to aid in the extraction of oil and gas.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=2&annotation=S6R468FV)
**🏷️** | CCUS | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">High operating costs due to the large energy requirements of capture, transport, and storage systems further inhibit the deployment of the technology, while the viability of various CCUS processes remains similarly constrained due to energy-related costs and the high cost of obtaining suitable chemical feedstocks</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=2&annotation=3LITX43A)
**🏷️** | CCUS | 


### 📍 Page 4

> <mark class="hltr-green">At present, the main methods for separating carbon dioxide from flue gas are absorption separation, adsorption separation, membrane separation, and low temperature distillation.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=4&annotation=AKVWN9M2)
**🏷️** | absorption | | adsorption | | carbon capture | | flue gas | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Among various CO2 separation methods, absorption separation is the most widely used method at present. The traditional absorption and separation method realizes the separation of CO2 by washing the mixed gas with the absorptive  solution.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=4&annotation=39EN7GJZ)
**🏷️** | absorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">According to the different kinds of absorptive solvent used, the absorption and separation method is mainly divided into physical absorption method and chemical absorption method</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=4&annotation=2LNGM26W)
**🏷️** | absorption | | chemisorption | | physisorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">The physical absorption method utilizes the principle that the carbon dioxide in the raw gas has a greater solubility in the absorptive solution. It can absorb and desorption carbon dioxide by alternately changing the temperature and pressure, so as to achieve the purpose of separating and capturing CO2. Generally, low temperature and high pressure are used for absorption, while high temperature and decompression are used for desorption. The decompression desorption requires less regenerative energy</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=4&annotation=RXQMABCH)
**🏷️** | absorption | | physisorption | 


### 📍 Page 5

> <mark class="hltr-green">Chemical absorption method is to use the chemical reaction between CO2 and solvent to achieve the absorption and desorption of carbon dioxide, because CO2 is weakly acidic, so  it can be absorbed by alkaline solution and removed. Chemical absorption method is usually carried out in the absorption tower, the solution and carbon dioxide reaction, carbon dioxide is absorbed by the solution, and then the solution into the desorption tower through heating decomposition, carbon dioxide is released, so as to fulfill the goal of CO2  capture. Traditional chemical absorption methods include hot potassium alkali method and alcohol-amine method</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=5&annotation=TYPTU59S)
**🏷️** | absorption | | chemisorption | | temperature | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">The chemical absorption methods using ethanol-amine as absorbers mainly include MEA method (monoethanolamine), DEA method (diethanolamine), and MDEA method (n-methyldiethanolamine). TEA method (triethanolamine) was used earlier in industry, but due to the low CO2 absorption efficiency of triethanolamine and the poor  K2CO3 + CO2 + H2O ⇌ 2KHCO3  stability of the solvent itself, it was gradually replaced by MEA method (ethanolamine) and DEA method (diethanolamine).</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=5&annotation=IQT7ZBZ7)
**🏷️** | absorption | | chemisorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">The absorption process uses less power. The disadvantage is that the solution regeneration consumes a lot of heat, and the corrosion of the equipment is serious. It is not suitable for the absorption of CO2 in the mixed gas  with high oxygen content and the solution is easy to be oxidized and degraded.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=5&annotation=JUZPFSXE)
**🏷️** | absorption | | chemisorption | | temperature | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">As a wet process, the process of chemical absorption method is relatively complicated. The fluid needs periodic temperature rise and fall, a large amount of external heating energy is needed for solution regeneration, and the investment and operation cost are also high.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=5&annotation=JA6SL256)
**🏷️** | absorption | | chemisorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">Water solvent has a high selectivity for CO2 absorption.  Its main disadvantage is that the solvent consumes a high amount of energy in the regeneration process, which consumes about 30% of the total output of the power plant.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=5&annotation=WZW7QYQB)
**🏷️** | adsorption | 


### 📍 Page 6

> <mark class="hltr-green">The adsorption process requires that the adsorbate can be effectively removed from the adsorbent during the regeneration process and the adsorption cycle time.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=6&annotation=9ZWG8H2P)
**🏷️** | adsorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">The adsorption performance is affected by the operating conditions, including the reactor’s temperature and pressure, the type of gas and so on</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=6&annotation=Y9WQJNSL)
**🏷️** | adsorption | | pressure | | temperature | 

> <mark class="hltr-blue">In the physical adsorption process, the adsorbent needs to have a high specific surface area and a porous structure to adsorb the adsorbate on its surface with the help of electrostatic attraction and van der Waals forces.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=6&annotation=98DJQ5K7)
**🏷️** | adsorption | | electrostatic attraction | | surface area | | van der Waals forces | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">During the chemisorption process, the adsorbate is adsorbed at the binding site on the adsorbent surface through covalent bonding</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=6&annotation=X6AVMPMT)
**🏷️** | adsorption | | chemisorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">For example, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) adsorb CO2 on the surface through unsaturated metal sites  or special functional groups on the surface. CO2 is adsorbed  on the surface of carbon materials by chemical adsorption through intrinsic functional groups or functional groups introduced by chemical modification</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=6&annotation=HIHYXY2P)
**🏷️** | adsorption | | chemisorption | | MOF | 

> <mark class="hltr-blue">Different theories show that the physical adsorption of gas molecules on the adsorbents surface occurs through the mass transfer process, while the selective adsorption is achieved through electrostatic attraction and  van der Waals forces</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=6&annotation=ETDXETCE)
**🏷️** | adsorption | | electrostatic attraction | | physisorption | | van der Waals forces | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">The cyclic adsorption of adsorbents is completed through the following three regeneration processes: (i) temperature swing adsorption (TSA), (ii) pressure swing adsorption (PSA), and (iii) vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VSA)</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=6&annotation=BD2LC3RJ)
**🏷️** | adsorption | | pressure swing adsorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">The difference between PSA and VSA is that in the PSA process, the adsorption tower is first filled with gas until it is saturated, and then the pressure of the adsorption tower is lowered to atmospheric pressure resulting in gas desorption. In the VSA process, the saturated adsorbent uses a vacuum in the adsorption tower to desorbed the gas</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=6&annotation=TKRSTQ2R)
**🏷️** | pressure | | pressure swing adsorption | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">TSA has received more attention because of its lower energy consumption in the adsorbent regeneration process, and is considered to be a potential method for CO2 capture in  industrial applications. In the process of TSA, flue gas is pumped into the adsorption tower, then heated to its desorption temperature. The increase of temperature will make the gas molecules free from the surface of the adsorbent.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=6&annotation=I3FDI899)
**🏷️** | adsorption | | temperature | | temperature swing adsorption | 


### 📍 Page 7

> <mark class="hltr-blue">The main criteria for selecting adsorbents include specific surface area, adsorption amount, pore size and pore volume, density, regeneration capacity, production method, selectivity, and sustainability of the target gas (adsorbate).</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=7&annotation=CBREQUX9)
**🏷️** | adsorption | | co2 selectivity | | density | | pore size | | pore volume | | regeneration capacity | | surface area | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Membrane separation is a new physical separation method that separates CO2 gas from flue gas through semi-permeable membrane. Compared with traditional solvent absorption methods, membrane separation technology is cheaper due to its low energy consumption (Ansaloni et al. 2017). The principle of membrane separation method is to realize the separation of CO2 by using the different velocities of CO2  and other components in the mixed gas through the membrane material, and the pressure difference is used as the driving force to promote the separation. Membrane separation technology is divided into two categories: gas separation membrane technology and gas absorption membrane technology.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=7&annotation=66JAS9D6)
**🏷️** | absorption | | membrane seperation | | pressure | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">The gas membrane separation technology relies on the chemical or physical reaction between the gas mixture to be separated and the membrane material to achieve rapid dissolution of the gas to be separated (CO2) and passage  through the membrane.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=7&annotation=MKW27QTD)
**🏷️** | membrane seperation | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">There are many membrane materials for CO2 separation,  such as mixed matrix membrane, carbon molecular sieve membrane, polymer membrane and inorganic membrane, etc</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=7&annotation=HNBWGCIS)
**🏷️** | membrane seperation | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">However, other parameters of these membranes, such as the production of defect-free membranes, brittleness, and operating costs, limit their application</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=7&annotation=UPU86I96)
**🏷️** | membrane seperation | 


### 📍 Page 8

> <mark class="hltr-red">The disadvantage of membrane separation method is that it is difficult to deeply remove and obtain high purity CO2, and the  loss of hydrocarbons is relatively serious.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=8&annotation=9CSIJAZG)
**🏷️** | membrane seperation | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Separation of CO2 by low temperature distillation requires  the removal of all components except N2 and CO2 from  the flue gas prior to cooling. When all other gases and particles have been removed, the remaining gas is sent to a cryogenic greenhouse, where the temperature and pressure are controlled to liquefy the carbon dioxide. Under appropriate conditions (the triple point temperature of CO2  is − 56.68 °C, ~ 7.4 atm), CO2 will condense and accumulate  at the bottom of the container, while N2 will remain as a  gaseous state and escape through the outlet at the top of the chamber.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=8&annotation=4AGPC7YP)
**🏷️** | low temperature distillation | | pressure | | temperature | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">Compared with other separation methods, the advantage of low temperature distillation is that the recovery rate of CO2 is very high, and the purity of CO2 after distillation  can exceed 99.95%</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=8&annotation=UWF9CT6U)
**🏷️** | low temperature distillation | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">However, the cryogenic process is very energy intensive, and the energy required to keep the system cool (usually using liquid nitrogen) makes the separation process too expensive</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=8&annotation=TTPRMLYA)
**🏷️** | low temperature distillation |

**🏷️** | MOF | 

> <mark class="hltr-blue">High and changeable porosity, extremely high specific surface area, chemical manipulation, structural variety, and other benefits can be found in MOFs. They show excellent performance in the fields of gas adsorption and separation, proton conduction, drug delivery, and so on, especially in the field of separation of various gas mixtures with unique selectivity</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=17&annotation=8XAY59DH)
**🏷️** | adsorption | | CCUS | | porosity | | surface area | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">MOFs can be divided into rigid MOFs and flexible MOFs</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=17&annotation=SCIMAT7Q)
**🏷️** | MOF | 


### 📍 Page 18

> <mark class="hltr-green">Rigid MOFs have strong and relatively stable channels. However, flexible MOFs have a soft framework that dynamically responds to stimuli. When certain stimuli are provided by the outside, such as temperature, pressure, and different guest molecules, the material structure changes, so that different guest molecules may exhibit different opening pressures.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=18&annotation=EXENTXSL)
**🏷️** | flexible MOF | | pressure | | rigid MOF | | temperature | 

> <mark class="hltr-green">MOFs are superior to zeolites in terms of working capacity, energy consumption, and efficiency. Their properties can be further improved by modification after synthesis, functionalization of organic linkers, and doping of nanomaterials in the skeleton</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=18&annotation=BMU8JFAH)
**🏷️** | MOF | 

> <mark class="hltr-blue">Through the rapid heat treatment after synthesis, the stronger interaction between CO2  molecules and MOF was realized, thus greatly improving the adsorption performance</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=18&annotation=86VYFISN)
**🏷️** | heat treatment | | MOF | | synthesis | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">The presence of water has a great impact on the CO2 capture performance of MOFs. Since water molecules and CO2  will form competitive absorption at the active site of MOFs, the CO2 absorption performance and selectivity of MOFs  materials will be reduced in the presence of water.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=18&annotation=QYUDUJG3)
**🏷️** | absorption | | MOF | | moisture | 

> <mark class="hltr-yellow">Balbuena (2013) studied the influence of water molecules on Mg-MOF-74 and found that water molecules would be linked to the coordination unsaturated metal sites, which greatly reduced the CO2 absorption performance of MgMOF-74</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=18&annotation=AVSAW8EN)
**🏷️** | MOF Example | | moisture | 

> <mark class="hltr-red">An economically viable MOF needs to be developed to efficiently store and separate large quantities of CO2.  In addition, the synthesis of metal complexes MOF from organic ligands is in many cases very expensive and the synthesis process is complex. Due to moisture absorption during CO2 capture, MOFs have durability and mechanical  strength issues. Therefore, the use of MOFs in power plants is limited.</mark> [🔗](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMWRBAJZ?page=18&annotation=8S426PP6)
