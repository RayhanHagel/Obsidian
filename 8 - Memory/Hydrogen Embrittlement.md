Proses peraupuhan logam karena hidrogen (H2) berdifusi ke dalam material

## Mekanisme
Temperatur tinggi ⭢ Hidrogen difusi masuk ⭢ harga impak turun ⭢ logam jadi brittle

The size of the H2 molecule is too large to diffuse through metals. Thus, hydrogen is dissociated into atoms on the metal surface and enters the materials in two distinct steps, known as adsorption and absorption.

Once absorbed into the metal, hydrogen atoms can occupy interstitial sites and jump from one site to another, moving through the material.

Hydrogen solubility is lower in bcc materials (e.g., ferritic steels) than in fcc (e.g., austenitic steels).
