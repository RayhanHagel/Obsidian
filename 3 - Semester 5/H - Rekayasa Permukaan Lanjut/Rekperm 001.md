# Heat Treatment
## Definition
Controlled heating and cooling of metals to alter their
physical and mechanical properties without changing
the shape
## Factors Affecting Metal Componen Malfunction
- Surface Deteroriation (70%)
- Breakage (15%)
- Obsolescence (15%)

## Surface Engineering Processes

Beneficial in:
- improving reliability, durability, and life span
- reducing manufacturing time and maintenance
- prolonging the service interval
- reducing harmful exhaust emission and waste

## Scales of Surface Engineering
![[Pasted image 20240919040030.png]]
Above is the thickness of the surface engineering technique. Surface Engineering can also be differentiated by the magnitude of hardness:
- Soft Metals or Spray Coatings: 250-300 HV
- Titanium Nitride PVD: 3500 HV
- Diamond Coatings: 10,000 HV

## Techniques in Surface Engineering
### Surface Preparation Technique
- Cleaning
- Descaling
### Surface Cover Technique
- Electroplating
- Painting
- Coating
- Thermal and plasma spraying
### Surface Modifying Technique
- Carburizing

### Test and Characterization Technique


## Aspect of Surface Engineering
Important aspects to consider are:
- Production cost
- Ecological aspects
- Economic Condition

## Wear Mechanisms
### Fatigue
- Stress cycles
- Micro-structural changes
- Cracking
- Delamination
### Abrasion
- Micro-cutting
- Micro-ploughing
- Micro-cracking
### Tribochemical Reactions
- Physisorption
- Chemisorption
- Formation of reaction layer
### Adhesion
- adhesion bonds
- material transfer

## Surface Coating Methods

### Plasma Treatment
Plasma can be used in many different cases whenever you would like to better adhere materials together or to change a surface property to suit your needs. Application of plasma:
- Cleaning surface of any residues, oils, or contamination
- Activation of various materials before gluing, painting
- Etching and partial removal of surfaces
- Coating with several types of layers (PTFE, etc)

### PVD
A type of vacuum deposition process where a material is vaporized in a vacuum chamber, transported atom by atom across the chamber to the substrate, and condensed into a film at the substrate's surface.
#### Evaporative PVD
##### The Classification
- Resistive
- Inductive
- Electron Beam Gun
- Arc
- Laser
#### Sputtering PVD
##### Basics
- A voltage is applied across a rarified gas.
- Breakdown of the gas forms a glow discharge plasma.
- Positive ions from the plasma strike the negative electrode.
- Energy from the ions is transferred to  target atoms.
- A few of these may escape from the target surface (they are sputtered).
- The sputtered atoms condense on the substrate forming a film.
##### The Classification
- Diode
- Magnetron
	a device in which a magnet system on the back of the cathode deflects the electrons, thus lengthening the ionization path. The accelerated ions transfer their momentum to particles of the coating material, which are then deposited on the substrate.
- Ion beam
	A physical vapor deposition process in which the coating material (target) is removed from the surface of the coating source (cathode) by a flux of high energy ions and deposited upon the surface of substrates.
- Triode
