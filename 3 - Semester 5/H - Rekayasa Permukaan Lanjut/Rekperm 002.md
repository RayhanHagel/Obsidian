## Modern Methods or techniques
- Electron, laser, implantation, glow discharge, CVD, PVD
- CVD based on the pressure:
	- Atmospheric pressure CVD
	- Low pressure CVD
	- Metal organic CVD
	- plasma assited CVD
	- microwave CVD
- PVD based on the activation
	- activated reactive evaporation
	- bias activated reactive evaporation
	- thermoionic arc evaporation
	- hot hollow cathode discharge
	- ionized cluster beam deposition

## Benefits
- Extend product life
- improve wear, oxidation, and corrosion resistance
- Satisfy consumer needs for better and lower cost component
- Improve solderability
- improve electrical conductivity
- reduce emissions and environmental waste

## Surface preparation
Surface preparation is intended to enchance the bonding strenght to metal surfaces and also to improve the durability of the bond, especially when exposed to humid environments. The key to surface pretreatment of many metallic adherends is to generate stable, controlled oxide growth on their surfaces.

### The Function of Surface Preparation
- to remove or prevent the later formation of a weak layer on the surface of the substrate
- to maximize the degree of molecular interaction betwen  the adhesive and the substrate surface
- to optimeze the adhesion forces which develop across the interfaces and therfore ensure sufficient joint strenght, initially and during the service life of the bond

### Surface Preparation techniques
#### Cleaning
is a removal of oxide layer from the metal surface, it is a mechanical cleaning technique used to reduce superficial soil, dust, grime, insect droppings, accreations, or other surface deposits. The purpose is to remove foreign material which can be abrasive, acidic, hygroscopic, or degradative and most importantly to clean the adherands.
##### A. Solvent Cleaning
solvent cleaning is the process of removing soil from a surface an organic solvent without physically or chemically alterning the material being cleaned. The procedures are:
1. Vapor Degreasing
	The principle of vapor degreasing is scrubbing the part with hot solvent vapors.
	
2. Ultrasonic Vapor Degreasing
	The parts are initially cleaned either by the vapor rinse or by immersion in a boiling solvent. They are then immersed for ultrasonic scrubbing followed by rinsing with vapor or spray plus vapor.

 3. Ultrasonic Cleaning with Liquid Rinse
 4. Solvent wipe, immersion or spray

##### B. Intermediate Cleaning
is the process of removing soil from a surface by a physical, mechanical, or chemical means without alterning the material cleaning. This includes grit blasting, wire brushing, sanding, abrasive scrubbing, and alkaline or detergent cleaning.
##### C. Chemical Cleaning
ada foam cleaning, manual cleaning, automated cleaning
#### Grinding
 Is a material removal process in which abrasive particles are contained in a bonded grinding wheel that operates at very high surface speeds
##### A. Surface grinding
##### B. Centerless Grinding


#### Polishing
Is the removal of material to produce a scratch free, specular surface using fine (<3$\micro m$ ) abrasive particles. Polushing is typically done at very low speeds using either polishing clothes, abrasive films, or specially designed lapping plates.
##### A. Mechanical Polishing
##### B. Electro Polishing

#### Degreasing
#### Picking
is the removal of  a thin layer of a metal from the surface of the stainless steel. Picling is a process used to remove weld heat tinted layers from the surface.
A. Tank Immersion Pickling
B. SPray Pickling
C. Circulation Pickling
#### Etching
The removal of material from substrate by reaction or by ion bombardment is called as etching process
#### Buffing
Extension of polishing, this is also mechanical action as like polishing. FIne abrasives are used on soft disc made of cloth. Abrasive is supplied externally in the form of abrasive compound.
