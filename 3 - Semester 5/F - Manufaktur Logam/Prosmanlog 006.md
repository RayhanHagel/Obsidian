Advances in Metal Casting Technology
![[Pasted image 20240924082318.png]]
## Introduction (Sejarah)
- several thousand years ago: Copper based alloys (two part stone or ceramic mold)
- 6000 years ago: wax casting (indus valley civilization)
- Industrial Revolution: iron and steel produced in large amount.
- Light alloys aluminum, magnesium, and titanium $\rightarrow$ alternative to bronze, brass, iron and steel
- 19th century: automobiles (new products and high productivity processes)
	- Casting industry (mid 19th century): high and low pressure die casting
	- 1849: patent for an initial manually operated device grantes to sturges.
	- 1855: further automation in casting process is needed -> need small parts and high volume production
- 20th century: aluminum pressure die casting
	- linked with automotive industry
	- cold chamber hpdc system established before second world war
- Thir Industrial Revolution: computer numerical control, the implementation of automated system as a replacement to human control.
- Fourth industrial revolution: AI (using large amount of data)

Intinya: technological development in metal casting is considering current trends in market and boundary condition.

## Global Casting Industry: Facts and Figures (Current Time)
- 2000s to 2018: constant rise in output interupted from stagnant 2007-2010 and 2014-2016.
- 2019: covid -> reduction in production and advancement.
- 2020: supply chain disruption and chip shortage -> makes massive reduction

### Perkembangan Produksi = Pengurangan Produksi di tempat lain
Projections: increase in aluminum castings $\rightarrow$ makes decline in cast iron production
- western europe: cast iron decrease $\rightarrow$ increase in aluminum alloy
- shows production in lower complexity and lower value componenets is shifted to lower wage countries.
- china: penurunan gray cast iron dari 57% $\rightarrow$ 52.5% di antara 200-2015. peningkatan ductile iron dari 24% $\rightarrow$ 32%.

German Foundry Industry Association -> prognosis
- Ferrous Foundries -> Recovery from covid believed to happen in Germany, Eastern Europe, and Turkey. While other major producing counties is having stagnation.
- Asia:
	- India $\rightarrow$ growth
	- china $\rightarrow$ cannibalize japanese and korean production
- NAFTA Region: mexico may profit, while asia (korea, taiwan) having general recovery.

Developments in automotive industry $\rightarrow$ wake of electrification
- china benefit disproportionately high

Similar Events such as the pandemic which causes economic consequences:
- Breach of international law by Russian Federation's war of aggression against Ukraine
	- Russia
		- a major producer of metals (aluminum)
		- oil and gas supplier $\rightarrow$ higher cost for fossil fuels $\rightarrow$ threatening europe casting industry (Germany) 
	- Ukraine $\rightarrow$ titanium production

## Changing Markets, Changing Products
### Challanges and Trends
Major Challanges the industry faced back then (Bonollo et al, 2015)
- Zero Defect Environment
- Real time Process Control
- Correlation between process parameters
- Setup and optimization of techniques
- Process-Quality interralations
- Processess and tools to the foundry industry

Excluded
- Competing production processes
- Changing markets (automative industries rapid shift to E-mobility)
- Environmental regulations (requiring foundries to become green)

Major Industry challanges (BÃ¼chner)
- Globalization: emerging markets
- Technology: lightweight design and process competence
- Economics:
	- Investment requirements
	- Margin pressure
	- Industrial consolidation
	- Human Resources

Intinya: manufacturing industries (metal casting) is subject to change. The speed and impact of these changes has recently increased, fueled by industry 4.0 or smart factory

### Current Development Directions
#### E-Mobility
- Internal combustion engine $\rightarrow$ Changed to electric power
- Battery electric vehicles shows weight of cast components is 35-52% lower than ICE vehicles
- To adapt, the casting industry is moving towards structural castings and developing components for electric powertrains, such as housings for motors and battery packs, reflecting a broader trend in response to the rise of e-mobility. Tesla's Gigacasting concept exemplifies this shift.

**Housing for electric powertrain components**
- Requires effective thermal management $\rightarrow$ achieved by
	- liquid cooling
	- design approaches
		- includes high-pressure die casting (HPDC)
		- Cores are hard with HPDC $\rightarrow$ Alternatives 
			- Embedding hollow structures (aluminum tubes) $\rightarrow$ enchance thermal conductivity & eliminates mismatch thermal expensien coefficient between fluid and casting
			- temporary fillers
			- internal structuring

- LDPC (Low pressure die casting) and Sand Casting allows for complex cores and varied designs, as demonstrated by companies like volkswagen

**Rotor Casting**
- Need for high electrical conductivity $\rightarrow$ require aluminum alloy
- Complicated by
	- Geometry of the casting $\rightarrow$ Sufficient feeding is almost impossible $\rightarrow$ Shrinkage, Porosity, Cold Runs.
	- Porosity $\rightarrow$ mechanical and electromagnetic effects.
		- Mechanical: mass related unbalance
		- Electromagnetic: inhomogenous current distribution (distortion in electromagnetic field, inhomogenity of electromagnetic forces)
		- Reduce efficiency of the device.
![[Pasted image 20240924182626.png]]
Aluminum $\rightarrow$ wants high conductivity, sufficient strength, heat treatment $\rightarrow$ replace Al-Si with Al-Fe or Al-Ni eutectic system $\rightarrow$ High Eutectic volume percentage $\rightarrow$ achieved at low Fe or Ni $\rightarrow$ low solubility in $\alpha$-Al phase $\rightarrow$ guarantees high purity $\rightarrow$ high conductive primary phases
![[Pasted image 20240924183022.png]]

- Heat Treatment 520$\degree$C $\rightarrow$ Al-7Si $\rightarrow$ fragmentation, spheroidization, and coarsening of the eutectic silicon $\rightarrow$ can boost thermal conductivity 


#### Automotive Structural Castings
E-mobility $\rightarrow$ increase interest in structural casting. 

Tesla $\rightarrow$ Gigacasting technique $\rightarrow$ streamlines manufacturing method $\rightarrow$ produces front and rear vehicle bodies as single castings
Limited number of toolmakers $\rightarrow$ complicates handling and transport $\rightarrow$ new facilities are built adjacent to assembly plants.

*Benefit from broader introduction of structural automotive castings*
- Improved thermal management of molds:
	- reduction in cycle times by roughly 33%
	- increase in die life up to 50%
- Choice of alloys - no heat treatment required
	- Elimination of process steps
	- Elimination of distortion and residual stress
	- Improvement in energy balance
- Lightweight solution
	- minimum thickness below 2.5mm
	- advanced optimization tools

### Additive Manufacturing
Additive manufacturing advantage
- create complex geometries with extensive cores
- parts produced by Laser Beam Melting exhibit superior mechanical properties
- Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing has a slight environmental edge over green sand casting

Additive manufacturing hampered by
- limited productivity (Laser beam melting produces slower than HPDC)
- high material costs (metal powders as raw material exceed cast metal)

### Environmental Issues
- Green technology: aspects of its environmental impact include energy consumption, direct emmisions and waste.
- Reduction in energy: advanced and higher efficiency production technologies
- Ways to improve environmental balance:
	- Use of inorganic binders in sand casting (reduce emmisions and waste)
	- Reclamation and reuse of foundry sand (save natural resources and energy consumption)
	- Microspraying in high pressure die casting  (less waste and emmision, imrpove part quality)
	- Heat treatment with natural gas can be
		- adapted to use hydrogen
		- replaced with electric systems
