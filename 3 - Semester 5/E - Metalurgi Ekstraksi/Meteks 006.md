## Metal Extraction
![[Pasted image 20241009060333.png|300]]

- Extraction $\rightarrow$ [[Meteks 006#Persiapan Kuis#Leaching|Leaching]]
	- extraction involves acid, oxidizing agents, and/or complexing agent.
	- Solvent extraction or ion exchange, which releases acid or other ions back into solution
- Concentration $\rightarrow$ Chemical Seperation by Solvent Extraction
- Recovery $\rightarrow$ electrowinning
	- provides electrons needed to reduce metal to its metallic state
- Refining $\rightarrow$ electrorefining
	- high purity metals can be obtained
	- occurs by electrically forcing metal dissolution (anode) and redeposition (cathode)

- Precipitation
	- ngebuat ionic bond
- Hydrolysis
	- Ada H2O yang bereaksi
- Electrochemical
	- Ada anoda, ada katoda. Ini biasanya half cell
- Conversion
	- Senyawa diubah ke bentuk lain (CuO jadi CuSo4)
- Complexation
	- Pembuatan unsur kompleks $A(B)^+$ yang bentuknya ada positif/negatif
- Solvation
	- Pembuatan aqueous
- Ionic Diassociation
	- Senyawa dipecah jadi ion nya, (Na2SO4 jadi Na dan SO4)

### Leaching
- used in nonferrous metal production
- carried out on oxidized ores, oxide mixtures, sulfides ores or concentrates obtained by flotation, mattes from conversion operations, and ores containing precious metals in their native state
- Thermodynamics
	- Terjadi di daerah corrosion (yang ada positif dan negatif, abis itu harus dibawah water stability limit)
	- ![[Pasted image 20241009061835.png|300]]
- *Leaching Lixivian*
	- Acid Lixiviant: Sulfuric acid and Hydrochloric acid
	- Alkaline lixiviants: NaOH (caustic soda), CO3Na2 (sodium bicarbonate), NH3 (ammonia), CNNa (sodium cyanide)
	- Gangue
		- silica gangue: doesnt get attacked by sulfuric acid
		- carbonated gangue: dissolved by sulfuric acid
		- Alkaline (CO3Na2) used at limestone or magnesia gangue
- *In Situ Leaching*
	- Pumps water to the ground and sucks it back up to extract metal
	- Mechanism
		- ![[Pasted image 20241009063139.png|300]]
		- oxygenated groundwater injected into ore-bearing
		- metal dissolves into the oxygenated water
		- the solution is drawn into surface by production welss
		- metal is extracted in ion exchange welss
		- water is re-oxygenated and used again
	- Applied to soluble salt extraction
	- Reduces cost for excavation and reclamation
	- Not practiced for copper and gold
- *Dump Leaching*
	- Low grade ore is put in the edge of terrain (above liner) and then a leaching solution is dumped from the top to down, where it will be collected in a reservoir and then be collected
	- Amplify process: Good oxygen penetration and good bacterial activity
	- ![[Pasted image 20241009063154.png|300]]
	- Copper: solution contain acid
	- Gold: solution contain cyanide and hydroxide
- *Heap Leaching*
	- Low to medium grade ores
	- much shorter time than dump leaching
	- Leaching time
		- Simple oxides: <45 days because of high permeability, small particles, and shallow depths
		- Sulfide ores: ~600 days
	- ![[Pasted image 20241009063541.png|300]]
	- Permeability
		- Low: the solution will take more time to go through the heap
		- Moderate: the solution goes through the heap at the same rate
		- High: the part of the sprinkled got the solution, but the non sprinkled isnt contacted by the solution
- *Bioleaching*
	- uses bacteria that secrete enzyme for mineral oxidation
	- *Mixothropic bacteria*: energy from inorganic compound oxidation. Obtain carbon from organic carbon sourti
	- *Autotropich bacteria*: most common bacteria. energy from inorganic compound, such as ferrous ions. Cell carbon from dissolved carbon dioxide
	- *Heterotrophic bacteria*: energy and carbon from organic carbon sources such as sucrose
- **Leaching Reactors**
	- ![[Pasted image 20241009064724.png]]
	- Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor
		- operate with continuous feed (slurry). Agitated leaching is performed with 40-50% by weight solids in the slurry
	- Pachuka Tanks
	- Autoclave
		- Equipped with mechanical stirrer to keep solid particles in suspension. Injection of air and oxygen occurs in every compartment

## Metals Recovery
- *Electrowinning*
	- Electrons are forced from anode (inert) to cathode (metal recovery) by external applied
	- Parameters: potential, current density, voltage
	- Metal collected directly from cathode
- Electrorefining
	- Less energy intensive (because difference between two half cell reactions is zero)
	- Metal collected from sludge
- Cementation
- Dissolved Reducing Agent
